## Assignment-B3 Create a Shiny app

### App Description

- This Shiny app has three features:

- Sort the table by alcohol content.
  Use the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive tab.
  Filter the data based on the alcohol content.
  The first feature allows users to sort the wine dataset by the amount of alcohol each wine contains. This is useful because some users
  may be interested in wines with a higher or lower alcohol content, and this feature allows them to easily find those wines.

- The second feature uses the DT package to create an interactive table that allows users to sort and search the dataset. This is useful 
  because it makes it easier for users to explore the dataset and find the information they need.

- The third feature allows users to filter the dataset based on the alcohol content of the wines. This is useful because it allows users to   focus on wines within a specific alcohol range that they are interested in.

### Dataset
The **wine**[https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/wooldridge/wine.csv] dataset used in this app was sourced from the following URL: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/wooldridge/wine.csv. The app includes code to read the dataset and clean it up for use in the app.
